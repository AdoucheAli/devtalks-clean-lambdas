- intro
 * Random thoughts on using java 8 lamdas in a clean way
 * Highly opinionated view
 * Drawn from hundreds of code reviews
 * Assumes you know the basics of Lambdas and Streams in Java8
	- if you dont, check out the screencast from my workshop "Clean Lambdas & Streams in Java 8 - A Hands-on Experience" at Voxxed Days Bucharest 2017. You'll find a link on www.victorrentea.ro


- checking items in collections  :2'
 * .filter(p).findAny().isPresent() / .collect(toList()).size() >= 1 / .count() >= 1 / .anyMatch()
  
- Optional vs NPE  :7'
 * Customer.getProfile().getGoldCard().getDiscount();
  
- Stream Wrecks - break the long chains of Stream operations  :7'
 * Performance.. Do you really need to stream HUGE amount of data too big for your RAM? 
 * That is, are you using JDBC Cursors / Spring Data JPA methods returning Stream<Entity>?
	
- name your multi-line lambdas  :4'
 * .map(this::mapToOtherObj)
 * .map(OtherObj::new);
 * .map(mapper::toOtherObj);

- filter - Cherish your Predicates :5'
 * Highly reusable: new boolean getters is Entities
 * Use-case specific: new boolean functions in this::
 * Just explain the code: intermediary Predicate variables
 * Reusable parameterized predicates: static methods returning Predicate<Item>

- type-specific functionality  :9'
 * switch(type): simple++; always add default: throw new ...();
 * Polimorphysm (OOP) - too HEAVY/overengineering-- ?. "Favor Composition over Inheritance"
 * Map<Type, Function<params, rez>> (FP) - Yuck!
 * Functions in Enums: concise syntax++, forces you to implement all needed functions++
 
- Adapter Pattern by Composing Functions  :3'
 * pre-process the arguments / post-process the return value
 * .thenApply only when the sequence of steps are variable
  
- Proxy Pattern by Wrap-Around  :5'
 * When you need to be in the call stack of another function
 * Ex: measure the execution time of a method. 
 * Ex: start/end transactions, etc..

- Death of Template Methods by "Passing a Block" pattern  :8'
 * Instead of f(param) calls g implemented in subclasses
 * Give g as parameter to f -> f(param, g)
 * f is stateful ++, No more extends ++
  
- forEach is NOT FP :6'
 * effectively final - where do the local variables live in RAM?
 * fix with some mutable accumulator (Holder)
 * implies side effects: if short: OK. To loop over and accumulate some value -> NOT OK. (try .reduce)
